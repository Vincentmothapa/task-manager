# task-manager
This was the final Capstone Project for level 1 of the HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp.

The task manager keeps track of the various tasks assigned to various users. A user and tasks can be added by the admin user and a user cannot access information 
unless they have been registered by admin. The user's username and password are stored in user.txt and the various tasks are stored in tasks.txt. 
The format that users are added and tasks are written should be strictly adhered to.

Reports are generated with the relevant stats like the number of completed tasks and tasks that are overdue and so on and saved to task_overview.txt. 
User stats are also generated and saved to user_overview.txt. User stats include number of users registered, total number of tasks assigned to each user, tasks assign to the user that have been completed, and so on.
